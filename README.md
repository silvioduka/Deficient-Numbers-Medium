Deficient Numbers - Medium - from Coding Challenges by Silvio Duka


Last modified date: 2018-03-12

A number is considered deficient if the sum of its factors is less than twice that number. 

For Example: 

10 is a deficient number. 

Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10 

Sum is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 < 2 * 10 

Tasks: 

(Easy) Write a program to verify whether a given number is deficient or not. 

(Medium) Write a program to find all the deficient numbers in a range. 

(Hard) Given a number, write a program to display its factors, their sum and then verify whether it's deficient or not. .
